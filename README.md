# Plant-disease-Prediction
The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model (CNN) that can classify plant diseases based on leaf images. The system will take a scanned image of a leaf and predict whether it is healthy or affected by a disease. If diseased, it can also identify the specific type of disease.
